### Anthropic's Categorization
Both fall under "agentic systems" but with key architectural distinctions:

#### Workflows
- LLMs and tools orchestrated through predefined code paths
- Fixed sequences of operations
- Predictable execution patterns
- Limited adaptability but highly reliable

#### Agents
- LLMs dynamically direct their own processes
- Autonomous decision-making about tool usage
- Self-managed task execution
- Higher adaptability but potentially less predictable

### Key Differences
| Aspect | Workflows | Agents |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Autonomy | Limited | High |
| Predictability | High | Variable |
| Adaptability | Moderate | High |
| Control | External | Internal |
| Use Case | Structured tasks | Complex, variable tasks |
